# om-material-ui

A simple wrapper around React MaterialUI.  It is basically like bootstrap-cljs.

## Usage

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/om-material-ui/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/om-material-ui)

You can view a very basic sample by:
cd examples
lein cljsbuild once simple
Then going to resources/public/index.html in a browser

You should see a very basic input box, material ui-style.
